Hello there! This is the Github repository for **CoVis** - The Visualisation Dashboard of COVID-19 Twitter Sentiment Analysis. This project is based on analyzing the sentiment of tweets which help in understanding the pulse of the nation towards the pandemic.
Tweet is a post on the social media platform Twitter with a maximum of 140 characters. In this project the data for training was obtained from IEEE Datasets and tweets scrapped from Twitter over a period of 3 months using the Tweepy API. Transfer learning approach was adopted in building the models in the project.
Two deep learning models were used,namely:
1) RoBERTa - For Sentiment Analysis
2) RoBERTa-CNN - For Sentiment Triggers Extraction.
